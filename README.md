# Self-Auto-Watering-Arduino
The goal for this project is to have a self-sustained and automated watering system using an Arduino Nano.
This involves having a heavily optimized automated watering system for minimal power consumption so it can be used in combination with renewable power generation, such as solar or wind.


This project in its complete form, will involve collecting rain water and using solar and/or wind power generation with a automated Arduino watering system setup.

What is required: (Add model numbers/links)
Arduino Nano
Moisture sensors
Water pumps
Battery pack that has passthrough charging (Using recycled 18650 cells is a plus)
Arduino supported Relay (5v GPIO) (I have data comparing different ones)
Solar and/or wind generation (Ideally something that is native 5V and not stepped down)


Once the code and system is properly optimized, I will be testing the performance for a year to figure out the shortfalls.
